                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #EFE9EA">The MotorPH Payroll System will now be automated and have role-based access control. In this section, the following processes and features the system offers, as well as how to use them, will be discussed.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 id = "login_procedures" style="color: #403637; text-align: center;">~ ○ ~</h2>

                    <h2 class="title section-heading" style="color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">- Secure Login Procedures -</h2><br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #EFE9EA">Starting up the preferred IDE, the user should run the code. Running the code will cause the system to display a login pop-up screen for the user to enter valid credentials in order to gain access. Information on three fields is needed: username, role, and password. For the username, the system created will accept the employee number of the user. For the role, a drop-down list will be provided for the user to choose which department they belong to (HR, Payroll, or Employee). And lastly, for the password, a unique yet uniform one was provided for each employee. Once the following has been inputted, simply clicking on the <b>LOG IN</b> button will give the user access to the system based on their role and if they put in the correct information.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2 class="title section-heading" style="color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">- Time In and Time Out Applications -</h2><br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #EFE9EA">In recording the attendance of the employees, the system provides an attendance page where the user can time in and time out, as well as see or check their previous attendance records. By simply clicking on the <b>Time in</b> button, the system will process, record, and then display the exact time the user clocked in, along with the current date. This process goes the same for clocking out as well, when they click on the <b>Time out</b> button.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 id = "calculations" style="color: #403637; text-align: center;">~ ○ ~</h2>

                    <h2 class="title section-heading" style="color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">- Salary, Allowance, and Deduction Calculations -</h2><br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #EFE9EA">The salary calculation for each employee will be calculated based on their total hours worked as seen in their attendance records, including their approved overtime, during a certain period. For the allowances given and deductions applied to their salary, the payroll system will just follow and process the amount set by the company and local tax laws, respectively.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 id = "leave" style="color: #403637; text-align: center;">~ ○ ~</h2>

                    <h2 class="title section-heading" style="color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">- Leave Applications -</h2><br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #EFE9EA">In applying for leave, the system provides a request page where the user can file for one. On this page, the following fields should be answered: request type, start date, and end date, as well as the reason for the request, if applicable. For the request type, a drop-down list will be provided by the system for the user to choose from (sick leave, emergency leave, vacation leave, bereavement leave, single parent leave, and maternity leave). For the start date and end date, the user should input the duration of their leave, respectively. And lastly, for the reason for request, the user should simply input the reason for filing this. After answering each field, the user should just click the <b>Submit</b> button for the system to process their request and send it to the assigned department for approval.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #54494A">The MotorPH payroll system is designed based on use case and class diagrams that illustrate the processes that are happening within the system, which involve streamlining and automating the viewing of employee information, tracking of attendance, calculations of salary, and processing of leave requests. Internal and external testing of the system will also be seen and discussed in this section to provide an overview with regards to feedback and issues that the team has encountered in operating the system. Going through all these will give a better understanding in terms of the technical aspect and quality assurance development process of the MotorPH payroll system.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #54494A">This use case diagram consists of 3 entities (Employee, Payroll, HR) and 5 key processes (for Login, Profile, Attendance, Salary, and Request).
                    <br><br>
                    For the first process, after the Employee entity inputs their login information, the system will verify if they put in the correct credentials. If not, the system will display an error pop-up message to prompt the user to login again.
                    <br><br>
                    For the second process, after successfully logging in, the Employee entity can now view their personal information. Then, for the other entities, the Payroll and HR departments can access the employee database.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, for the third process, the Employee entity can view their attendance records as well as clock in and clock out. The HR entity handles the attendance records of the employees, integrating the time and attendance, tracking when they clock in and clock out, and calculating their total hours worked. The Payroll entity calculates the total hours worked by the employee for the final salary calculation as well.
                    <br><br>
                    For the fourth process, the Employee entity can view their salary records. Then, considering their attendance records, the system will calculate the final salary calculation for each employee, as well as adding the allowance given and deductions applied by the company and local tax laws, respectively.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, for the fifth process, all 3 entities can file a request, such as for leave (sick leave, emergency leave, vacation leave, bereavement leave, single parent leave, and maternity leave).</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #54494A">This figure shows the class diagram of the MotorPH payroll system, comprising 12 interconnected classes. The connections between them are represented by various arrowheads, which will be discussed later on. The 12 classes displayed here are Login, Employee, HR, Payroll, Attendance, AttendanceCalculator, Salary, SalaryCalculator, Allowance, Deduction, Request, and RequestCalculator.
                    <br><br>
                    The Login class manages the login processes of the MotorPH payroll system. It includes attributes such as “employee_username” (a string variable), “role” (string), and “password” (char). Noticeably, there is a dashed line preceding the attributes in this class, indicating that they are private and can only be accessed within the Login class. Additionally, this class features a method named “verifyLogin()”, marked with a plus (+) symbol signifying its public accessibility. The verifyLogin() method verifies login credentials, such as the username and password inputted by the user on the login page of the system. It is also connected to the Employee class with an arrowhead depicting a broken line. This relationship is categorized as a dependency, signifying that the Employee class relies on the Login class. Essentially, a user can only access one employee profile, i.e., their own account, via login.
                    <br><br>
                    The Employee class displays basic employee information upon user login to the system. This information is represented by private attributes, including “employeeID” (an integer variable or int), “firstname” (string), “lastname” (string), “role” (string), “department” (string), “supervisor” (string), “status” (string), “birthday” (string), “sss_number” (string), “pagibig_number” (string), “philhealth_number” (string), and “tin_number” (string). Additionally, this class features public methods “viewEmployeeRecords()” and “fetchEmployee()”. The viewEmployeeRecords() method displays employee information in the system, while the fetchEmployee() method retrieves employee information from data storage, typically a CSV file, making it accessible to the system. The Employee class establishes an inheritance (or generalization) relationship with the HR and Payroll classes, with the Employee class serving as the parent and the HR and Payroll classes as its children. In simpler terms, the HR and Payroll classes inherit attributes and methods from the Employee class. Moreover, their relationship implies that one or more employees can access either HR or Payroll functionalities, depending on their roles. Additionally, the Employee class has a composition relationship with Attendance, Salary, and Request classes, indicating that these classes cannot exist without the Employee class. The relationship between the Employee class and the Attendance class is one-to-one or more, similarly for the Employee class and the Salary class, while the relationship between the Employee class and the Request class is one-to-zero or more, meaning there can be zero requests in an employee account.
                    <br><br>
                    Moving on to the Attendance class, it manages attendance records and time-in and time-out functionality for employees. It includes attributes such as “month” (string), “timein” (double), “timeout” (double), “hours” (double), and “overtime” (double). This class derives its methods through a usage relationship with an abstract class “AttendanceCalculator”, featuring methods like “calcHours()” (for calculating total worked hours by the employee) and “calcOvertime()” (for calculating overtime hours). Furthermore, the Attendance class has a dependency relationship with the HR class, indicating that an HR user can access one or more attendance records of employees.
                    <br><br>
                    Regarding the Salary class, it handles the presentation and calculation of employee salary information. Its attributes include “period_start” (date), “period_end” (date), “hourly_rate” (double), “monthly_rate” (double), “grossSalary” (double), and “netSalary” (double). This class acquires method functionalities through a usage relationship with an abstract class “SalaryCalculator”, featuring methods such as “calcGrossSalary()” (for calculating gross salary), “calcNetSalary()” (for calculating net salary), “calcAllowance()” (for calculating total allowance), and “calcDeductions()” (for calculating total deductions). Additionally, the Salary class has a dependent relationship with the Payroll class, meaning that one payroll can access one or more salary information instances, and the Payroll can edit salary information based on its methods. The Salary class also establishes a composition relationship with Allowance and Deduction classes, indicating that one or more salary information of an employee can include either allowance or deduction information. The Allowance class includes attributes such as “rice_subsidy” (double), “phone_allowance” (double), “clothing_allowance” (double), and “total_allowance” (double), contributing to the allowance information of the employee. This class inherits the “calcAllowance()” method from the Salary class. Similarly, the Deduction class includes attributes like “sss_deduction” (double), “pagibig_deduction” (double), “philhealth_deduction” (double), “withholdingtax_deduction” (double), and “total_deduction” (double), which represent deduction information of the employee. This class inherits the “calcDeductions()” method from the Salary class.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, the Request class manages leave requests made by employees. It includes attributes such as “leave” (int), “leave_type” (string), “leave_startdate” (date), “leave_enddate” (date), “request_status” (string), “approver” (string), and “approved_date” (date). These attributes are populated by values retrieved through the method “fetchRequest()”, which gathers data from the system and stores it in a CSV file. The Request class has a usage relationship with the abstract class “RequestCalculator”, using its method “calcLeave” to calculate the remaining leave for an employee. Additionally, it has a dependent relationship with HR and Payroll classes, allowing these classes to manipulate data stored within the Request class. The HR class includes a method “approveRequest()”, granting HR users the ability to approve leave requests made by employees. Similarly, the Payroll class includes a method “syncApprovedRequest()”, enabling Payroll users to automatically adjust an employee's salary based on approved leave.
                    <br><br>
                    In summary, these classes, attributes, and methods constitute the essential components of the MotorPH payroll system. They facilitate processes such as viewing employee information, tracking attendance, computing salary, and managing leave requests for MotorPH employees.</p>
