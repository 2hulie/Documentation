                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #DDEEF8">Starting up the executable file (<b>MotorPH_Payroll_System.exe</b>), the user should run the code. Running the code will cause the system to display a login pop-up screen for the user to enter valid credentials in order to gain access. Information on three fields is needed: username, password, and role. For the username, the system created will accept the employee number of the user. For the password, a unique yet uniform one was provided for each employee. And lastly, for the role, a drop-down list will be provided for the user to choose which department they belong to (<b>Employee, HR, Payroll,</b> or <b>IT</b>). Once the following has been inputted, simply clicking on the <b>LOG IN</b> button will give the user access to the system based on their role and if they put in the correct information.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #DDEEF8">In recording the attendance of the employees, the system provides an attendance page where the user can time in and time out, as well as see or check their previous attendance records. By simply clicking on the <b>Time in</b> button, the system will process, record, and then display the exact time the user clocked in, along with the current date. This process goes the same for clocking out as well, when they click on the <b>Time out</b> button.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #DDEEF8">The salary calculation for each employee will be calculated based on their total hours worked as seen in their attendance records, including their approved overtime, during a certain period. For the allowances given and deductions applied to their salary, the payroll system will just follow and process the amount set by the company and local tax laws, respectively.</p>
                    <h2 id = "leave" style="color: #162834; text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">--</h2>
                    <h2 class="title section-heading" style="color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 25px; text-align: center;"><i>iii. Leave Applications</i></h2><br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #DDEEF8">In applying for leave, the system provides a request page where the user can file for one. On this page, the following fields should be answered: request type, start date, and end date, as well as the reason for the request, if applicable. For the request type, a drop-down list will be provided by the system for the user to choose from (sick leave, emergency leave, vacation leave, bereavement leave, single parent leave, and maternity leave). For the start date and end date, the user should input the duration of their leave, respectively. And lastly, for the reason for request, the user should simply input the reason for filing this. After answering each field, the user should just click the <b>Submit</b> button for the system to process their request and send it to the assigned department for approval.</p>
                    <h2 id = "overtime" style="color: #162834; text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">--</h2>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #DDEEF8">In submitting an overtime request, the system provides that option on the attendance page as well. In the table integrated into the system, which also records the attendance of the user when they clock in and clock out, a button labeled "Request Overtime" can be seen below, which, once clicked, will submit a request for overtime to the HR department for approval. The overtime request history can also be accessed by clicking the <b>View Overtime Request History</b> button just beside the <b>Request Overtime</b> button.</p><br>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #223B4B">The MotorPH payroll system is designed based on use case and class diagrams that illustrate the processes that are happening within the system, which involve streamlining and automating the viewing of employee information, tracking of attendance, calculations of salary, and processing of leave requests. Internal and external testing of the system will also be seen and discussed in this section to provide an overview with regards to feedback and issues that the team has encountered in operating the system. Going through all these will give a better understanding in terms of the technical aspect and quality assurance development process of the MotorPH payroll system.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #223B4B">This use case diagram consists of 3 entities (Employee, Payroll, HR) and 5 key processes (for Login, Profile, Attendance, Salary, and Request).
                    <br><br>
                    For the first process, after the Employee entity inputs their login information, the system will verify if they put in the correct credentials. If not, the system will display an error pop-up message to prompt the user to login again.
                    <br><br>
                    For the second process, after successfully logging in, the Employee entity can now view their personal information. Then, for the other entities, the Payroll and HR departments can access the employee database.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, for the third process, the Employee entity can view their attendance records as well as clock in and clock out. The HR entity handles the attendance records of the employees, integrating the time and attendance, tracking when they clock in and clock out, and calculating their total hours worked. The Payroll entity calculates the total hours worked by the employee for the final salary calculation as well.
                    <br><br>
                    For the fourth process, the Employee entity can view their salary records. Then, considering their attendance records, the system will calculate the final salary calculation for each employee, as well as adding the allowance given and deductions applied by the company and local tax laws, respectively.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, for the fifth process, all 3 entities can file a request, such as for leave (sick leave, emergency leave, vacation leave, bereavement leave, single parent leave, and maternity leave).</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #223B4B">This figure shows the class diagram of the MotorPH payroll system, comprising 12 interconnected classes. The connections between them are represented by various arrowheads, which will be discussed later on. The 12 classes displayed here are Login, Employee, HR, Payroll, Attendance, AttendanceCalculator, Salary, SalaryCalculator, Allowance, Deduction, Request, and RequestCalculator.
                    <br><br>
                    The Login class manages the login processes of the MotorPH payroll system. It includes attributes such as “employee_username” (a string variable), “role” (string), and “password” (char). Noticeably, there is a dashed line preceding the attributes in this class, indicating that they are private and can only be accessed within the Login class. Additionally, this class features a method named “verifyLogin()”, marked with a plus (+) symbol signifying its public accessibility. The verifyLogin() method verifies login credentials, such as the username and password inputted by the user on the login page of the system. It is also connected to the Employee class with an arrowhead depicting a broken line. This relationship is categorized as a dependency, signifying that the Employee class relies on the Login class. Essentially, a user can only access one employee profile, i.e., their own account, via login. The Login class also has a 0 or many to 1 dependency relationship with the IT class, as the IT class has access to the accounts to manage role-based access of the users.
                    <br><br>
                    The Employee class displays basic employee information upon user login to the system. This information is represented by private attributes, including “employeeID” (an integer variable or int), “firstname” (string), “lastname” (string), “role” (string), “department” (string), “supervisor” (string), “status” (string), “birthday” (string), “sss_number” (string), “pagibig_number” (string), “philhealth_number” (string), and “tin_number” (string). Additionally, this class features public methods “viewEmployeeRecords()” and “fetchEmployee()”. The viewEmployeeRecords() method displays employee information in the system, while the fetchEmployee() method retrieves employee information from data storage, typically a CSV file, making it accessible to the system. The Employee class establishes an inheritance (or generalization) relationship with the HR, IT and Payroll classes, with the Employee class serving as the parent and the HR, IT and Payroll classes as its children. In simpler terms, the HR, IT and Payroll classes inherit attributes and methods from the Employee class. Moreover, their relationship implies that one or more employees can access either HR, IT or Payroll functionalities, depending on their roles. Additionally, the Employee class has a composition relationship with Attendance, Salary, and Request classes, indicating that these classes cannot exist without the Employee class. The relationship between the Employee class and the Attendance class is one-to-one or more, similarly for the Employee class and the Salary class, while the relationship between the Employee class and the Request class is one-to-zero or more, meaning there can be zero requests in an employee account.
                    <br><br>
                    Moving on to the Attendance class, it manages attendance records and time-in and time-out functionality for employees. It includes attributes such as “month” (string), “timein” (double), “timeout” (double), “hours” (double), and “overtime” (double). This class derives its methods through a usage relationship with an abstract class “AttendanceCalculator”, featuring methods like “calcHours()” (for calculating total worked hours by the employee) and “calcOvertime()” (for calculating overtime hours). Furthermore, the Attendance class has a dependency relationship with the HR class, indicating that an HR user can access one or more attendance records of employees.
                    <br><br>
                    Regarding the Salary class, it handles the presentation and calculation of employee salary information. Its attributes include “period_start” (date), “period_end” (date), “hourly_rate” (double), “monthly_rate” (double), “grossSalary” (double), and “netSalary” (double). This class acquires method functionalities through a usage relationship with an abstract class “SalaryCalculator”, featuring methods such as “calcGrossSalary()” (for calculating gross salary), “calcNetSalary()” (for calculating net salary), “calcAllowance()” (for calculating total allowance), and “calcDeductions()” (for calculating total deductions). Additionally, the Salary class has a dependent relationship with the Payroll class, meaning that one payroll can access one or more salary information instances, and the Payroll can edit salary information based on its methods. The Salary class also establishes a composition relationship with Allowance and Deduction classes, indicating that one or more salary information of an employee can include either allowance or deduction information. The Allowance class includes attributes such as “rice_subsidy” (double), “phone_allowance” (double), “clothing_allowance” (double), and “total_allowance” (double), contributing to the allowance information of the employee. This class inherits the “calcAllowance()” method from the Salary class. Similarly, the Deduction class includes attributes like “sss_deduction” (double), “pagibig_deduction” (double), “philhealth_deduction” (double), “withholdingtax_deduction” (double), and “total_deduction” (double), which represent deduction information of the employee. This class inherits the “calcDeductions()” method from the Salary class.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, the Request class manages leave requests made by employees. It includes attributes such as “leave” (int), “leave_type” (string), “leave_startdate” (date), “leave_enddate” (date), “request_status” (string), “approver” (string), and “approved_date” (date). These attributes are populated by values retrieved through the method “fetchRequest()”, which gathers data from the system and stores it in a CSV file. The Request class has a usage relationship with the abstract class “RequestCalculator”, using its method “calcLeave” to calculate the remaining leave for an employee. Additionally, it has a dependent relationship with the HR class, allowing it to manipulate data stored within the Request class. The HR class includes a method “approveRequest()”, granting HR users the ability to approve leave requests made by employees. 
                    <br><br>
                    In summary, these classes, attributes, and methods constitute the essential components of the MotorPH payroll system. They facilitate processes such as viewing employee information, tracking attendance, computing salary, and managing requests for MotorPH employees.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #223B4B">For the first scenario, which is to <b>Check Login Functionality</b>, it has 3 test cases. In the first test case, the team launched the application by accessing the .exe file labeled <b>MotorPH_Payroll_System</b>. The expected result is successfully opening it and the system displaying the login window. The second test case is to log in with valid credentials. The expected result is entering the correct username, password, and assigned role for that employee. And lastly, the third test case is when the user inputs the wrong information when logging in. The expected result is that the system displays an error pop-up message that the user inputted incorrect information. All test cases for the first scenario passed.
                    <br><br>
                    For the second scenario, which is to <b>Check Employee Profile Functionality</b>, it has 2 test cases. After logging in, it will immediately display the Employee Profile window, and for the first test case, the user views their basic personal information presented in the text fields. The expected result is for the user to successfully see their basic personal information displayed in the Employee Profile window. The second test case is selecting any of the other buttons (<b>Attendance, Salary, and Request</b>) presented in this window, then going back to the Employee Profile window again. The expected result is that when the user navigates back to the Employee Profile window coming from the other windows mentioned, respectively, the user's basic personal information should still be displayed and visible to the user. All test cases for the second scenario passed.
                    <br><br>
                    For the third scenario, which is to <b>Check Attendance (Time In and Time Out) Functionality</b>, it has 3 test cases.

The expected result is that the system records the time the user clocked out as they clicked on the <b>Time Out</b> button. The third test case is selecting any of the other buttons (<b>Profile, Salary, and Request</b>) presented in this window, then going back to the Attendance window again. The expected result is that when the user navigates back to the Attendance window coming from the other windows mentioned, respectively, the user's attendance records should still be displayed and visible to the user. All test cases for the third scenario passed.
                    <br><br>
                    For the fourth scenario, which is to <b>Check Salary Functionality</b>, it has 2 test cases. This explores the functionality of the features presented in the Salary window, and the first test case is typing the period start date and period end date on the given text field, respectively. The expected result is that when the user inputs the time period they want to view regarding their salary information at the time, the system will display it. This includes the hourly rate, monthly rate, gross salary, and net salary of the user for that period, along with the SSS, Pag-IBIG, PhilHealth, withholding tax, and total deductions applied, as well as the rice subsidy, phone allowance, clothing allowance, and total allowance the user received.

All test cases for the fourth scenario passed.
                    <br><br>
                    For the fifth scenario, which is to <b>Check Request Functionality</b>, it has 3 test cases. This explores the functionality of the features presented in the Request window, and the first test case is clicking the <b>Submit</b> button with all parts of the request form integrated in the system answered. The expected result is that the system records the user's request input after submission and sends it to the HR department for approval. The integrated request form on this page will then be reset with blank text fields that the user can fill out once again. The second test case is clicking the <b>Submit</b> button without answering any parts of the request form integrated into the system. The expected result is that the system displays an error pop-up message that they should fill out the integrated request form on this page.

                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: #223B4B">Moving forward, the MotorPH Payroll System was then subjected to external testing by other individuals outside of the team that created the system. Those individuals were first introduced to the system application, its expected features, and how they would be able to access it. After that, they were instructed to fill out the actual outcomes that they have experienced in using the system in accordance with the scenarios laid out by the team. They were also asked to give some feedback regarding the system so that the team would be able to improve it even further. The results of the external testing can be seen in the PDF file below.</p>
